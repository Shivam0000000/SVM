    "In the context of developing an SVM regression model to predict house prices based on various characteristics, you can\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "MAE measures the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. It provides a straightforward \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "MSE calculates the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Squaring the errors gives more weight \n",
    "to larger errors. MSE is commonly used and penalizes larger errors more than MAE, making it sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
    "RMSE is the square root of the MSE. It is also commonly used and has the advantage of being in the same unit as the target \n",
    "variable (house prices in this case), making it easier to interpret in the context of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared (R2) Score:\n",
    "R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1,\n",
    "with higher values indicating a better fit. However, R-squared can be misleading when used in isolation, especially if the model \n",
    "is overfitting.\n",
    "\n",

    "Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):\n",
